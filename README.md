# TicTacToe Game
## Introduction
This is our rendition of the classic 3x3 board simple and strategic game that you play with a friend. It uses JSwing and JFrame in order to create the visuals when the program is run.

## Progress report
Matthew Cao, and Rohan Suvarna
We have made the board class with a 2D array and print it in the console. With the + as the highlight(player). Then made a 
MainFrame class which mainly has the key commands. Next we made a marker class which contains all the move functions. And
checks if the player can move and place the marker in the spot in which they move. So far we have been able to make the 
board and allow people to place their X or O on the board; however, we still need to be able to check whether or not the player 
has one. We made a different function for the column, row and diagonal win as those are the only wins that are possible 
in tic-tac-toe. But we are now focusing on being able to draw a swoosh through all of the winning markers(not just have a line 
pop up). We also want to make an animation for when each X or O is placed and have them drop down. On top of this we want to make
the game fully customizable, allowing people to change the type of marker they use, allowing people to choose their sound, 
and choose their color scheme, and more We also need to add sounds when someone adds a X or O or when someone wins, also maybe
some background music to make it more fun to play. Some of the struggles we encountered were removing the highlight when 
we move it to the next box, and making it alternate between X and O properly. But these errors have been fixed.
